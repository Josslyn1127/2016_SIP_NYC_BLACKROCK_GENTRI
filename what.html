  <p id="conclusion"> As you can tell, gentrification isn't always a negative addition to neighborhoods. It can create both positive and negative aspects to a community. Many people are experiencing gentrification and have different opinions on it. We do not want to make it seem one-sided which is why we are explaining what gentrification so that people can create their own opinions on it. </p>
