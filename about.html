				<h2>Who are we?</h2>
				<p>We are coding rockstars! Seven weeks ago, we walked into the Blackrock building to begin our first day of Girls Who Code, a summer computer science intensive program. Throughout our time here, we have explored several languages including Python, Scratch, C++, Arduino, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This is our final project. </p>
